These are the projects I worked on while completing the 3-part Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online! Throughout this course, I have learned various machine learning and deep learning concepts and leveraged in-demand Python frameworks such and Tensorflow and scikit-learn. 

Here is an overview of the concepts I learned throughout this specialization.

â€¨Course 1: Supervised Learning
- Built ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn
- Trained supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)

Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Implemented neural networks in Tensorflow to perform linear and logistic regression
- Built softmax regression (multi-class classification) models with TensorFlow
- Leveraged decision trees and tree ensembles (Random Forest and XGBoost) for inferencing

Course 3: Unsupervised Learning
- Used unsupervised learning techniques for clustering and anomaly detection
- Built recommender systems with both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches 
- Implemented deep reinforcement learning models
